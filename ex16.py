Password Generator    
Exercise 16 (and Solution)

Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

Extra:

    Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

 - Another challenge from Joe, use a different method but similar to random.choice() to get all characters at once

import string
import random

def genPassword():
    print "Let me generate a strong random password for you."
    password = ""
#    lletters = list(string.ascii_lowercase)
#    uletters = list(string.ascii_uppercase)
#    numbers = range(0,10)
#    symbol = list(string.punctuation)
#    randchar = lletters + uletters + numbers + symbol
    randchar = list(string.ascii_lowercase) + list(string.ascii_uppercase) + range(0,10) + list(string.punctuation)
    rlength = random.randint(10, 24)
    while len(password) < rlength:
        password += str(random.choice(randchar))
    return password
